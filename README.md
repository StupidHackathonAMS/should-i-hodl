## About
`should-i-hodl` is a state of the art, blockchain.info API powered application that tells you whether you should hold on to your cryptocurrencies, or dump them.


*What’s HODL? I understand it means HOLD but why do we switch up the last two letters? I haven’t been here long enough. What’s the history?*


**I AM HODLING**

> I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.


So basically this application is for those too dumb to understand trading, but too smart** to panic and dump coins every time things go south.

** Up for debate.

## How does it work?
* Uses the blockchain.info API to fetch the last Bitcoin market value, and yesterday’s average market value
* Determines whether you should hold by subtracting yesterday’s value from today’s value
* If the balance is positive, YOU HOLD
* If the balance is negative, YOU HOLD

## Where can I see if I should hold or not?
